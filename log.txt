        /home: Route for the main landing page.

        /play: Route for the game selection page.

        src/features/: Contains all the complex UI logic and components.

        /home: Components specific to the home page (HomePageLayout.tsx).

        /play: Components specific to the play page (PlayPageLayout.tsx).

        /shared/components: Reusable components used across the entire application (Header.tsx, Footer.tsx).
